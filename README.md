This article explains how to open Command Prompt, which is one of the command-line interface programs used to execute commands in Windows operating systems. While it probably isn't a tool most of you will use on a regular basis, Command Prompt can really come in handy now and then, maybe to troubleshoot a specific Windows problem or to automate some kind of task.

## How to use the command prompt?

Many Windows users regularly use the GUI. However, it is helpful to know how to execute system functions in the command prompt window. For example, basic functions such changing a directory or performing an examination of the system disk are easy to execute at the command level.

_There are various ways to open command prompt. A common one in Windows is to use the command prompt shortcut located in the Start menu or on the Apps screen._

* The basic command level might look like this:
 * C:\Windows\system32\>cmd.exe and <enter>
* This results in the following:
 * C:\>
* The OS is now ready for a command. Each command launches a batch file that initiates a specific function. The change directory function looks like this:
 * C:\>dir and <enter>
* This presents a list of available directories linked to the root directory -- for example, the C drive -- in the system. To change to a different directory, the following is performed, using the example of changing to a directory called applications:
 * C:\>cd applications\ and <enter>
* This changes the directory to:
 * C:\applications\>
* Now the system needs a command to execute something in the applications directory. To check on the status of the elements associated with a specific directory, the user enters the following at the command prompt:
 * C:\applications\>chkdsk and <enter>

_The OS executes the chkdsk utility for the applications directory and presents a summary of the components in that directory, such as the number of files and subdirectories, and number of bytes in use and the number available._

## Open Command Prompt in Windows 11 or 10

**_There are a few ways, but using the search bar on the taskbar is one quick method._**

* Select the Start button.
* Type cmd.
* Select Command Prompt from the list.

## Open Command Prompt Using Power User Menu

One more method is through the Power User Menu. If you're using a keyboard or mouse, choose Windows Terminal (Windows 11) or Command Prompt (Windows 10) from the menu that appears after pressing Win+X or right-clicking the Start button.

## Other Ways to Open Command Prompt

Command Prompt in Windows 11 through Windows XP can also be opened with a command. This is especially helpful if you like using the Run dialog box or if File Explorer has crashed and the Start menu is inaccessible (and thus the directions above don't work).

To do this, enter cmd into the command-line interface. This can be in the Run dialog box (WIN+R) or Task Manager's File > Run new task menu.
